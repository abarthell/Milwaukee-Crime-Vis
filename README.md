# Milwaukee Crime Visualization 
By: Anthony Barthell

## Motivation
Boasting a population of [nearly 600,000 residents](http://www.city-data.com/city/Milwaukee-Wisconsin.html), Milwaukee is the largest city in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, Milwaukee has been consistently ranked as [one of the most dangerous cities in America](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-most-dangerous-cities-in-america/40/). As a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I took the initiative to analyze [Milwaukee's criminal data](https://data.milwaukee.gov/dataset/wibr/resource/87843297-a6fa-46d4-ba5d-cb342fb2d3bb) in order to find out what was truly going on.
